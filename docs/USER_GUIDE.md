## Workflow Management

### Creating Workflows

Workflows in the Multi-Agent MCP system define sequences of operations that can be executed automatically. Each workflow consists of nodes (individual operations) and connections (the flow between operations).

The system provides several pre-built workflow templates that cover common use cases. These templates can be customized to meet your specific requirements or used as starting points for more complex workflows.

**Workflow Templates:**

The Web Scraping Pipeline template provides a complete workflow for collecting data from websites, processing it through the knowledge base creator, and storing the results in a database. This template is ideal for content aggregation, competitive intelligence, and market research applications.

The Data Transformation Pipeline template focuses on converting data between different formats using the intelligent transformer agent. This is particularly useful for e-commerce data migration, format standardization, and cross-platform data synchronization.

The Complete Data Processing Pipeline combines all agents in a comprehensive workflow that can handle end-to-end data processing from collection through transformation and storage.

**Creating Custom Workflows:**

To create a custom workflow, you define the nodes and their connections. Each node specifies the agent to call, the endpoint to use, and any parameters required for the operation.

```json
{
  "name": "Custom Product Processing",
  "description": "Process product data from multiple sources",
  "workflow_definition": {
    "nodes": [
      {
        "id": "trigger",
        "type": "webhook",
        "name": "Data Input"
      },
      {
        "id": "scraper",
        "type": "agent_call",
        "name": "Collect Product Data",
        "parameters": {
          "agent_id": "agent1_scraper",
          "endpoint": "/api/scraper/scrape",
          "method": "POST"
        }
      },
      {
        "id": "transformer",
        "type": "agent_call",
        "name": "Transform to Standard Format",
        "parameters": {
          "agent_id": "agent4_transformer",
          "endpoint": "/api/transformer/transform",
          "method": "POST"
        }
      }
    ],
    "connections": [
      {"from": "trigger", "to": "scraper"},
      {"from": "scraper", "to": "transformer"}
    ]
  }
}
```

### Executing Workflows

Workflows can be executed in several ways. Manual execution allows you to trigger workflows on-demand with specific input data. This is useful for testing workflows or handling ad-hoc processing requests.

Webhook-triggered execution enables automatic workflow execution when external systems send data to your webhook endpoints. This is the primary integration method for n8n and other automation platforms.

Scheduled execution allows workflows to run automatically at specified times or intervals. This is useful for regular data collection, backup operations, or periodic data synchronization tasks.

### Monitoring Workflow Execution

The system provides comprehensive monitoring capabilities for workflow execution. You can track the status of individual workflow runs, monitor execution times, and identify bottlenecks or failures.

Execution logs provide detailed information about each step in the workflow, including input data, output results, and any errors that occurred. This information is essential for debugging workflow issues and optimizing performance.

Performance metrics help you understand how your workflows are performing over time. You can track execution times, success rates, and resource utilization to identify opportunities for optimization.

## n8n Integration

### Setting Up n8n Integration

The Multi-Agent MCP system is designed to integrate seamlessly with n8n workflow automation platform. The integration is achieved through webhook endpoints that n8n can call to trigger workflows and receive results.

**Webhook Configuration:**

To integrate with n8n, you first create webhook endpoints in the Multi-Agent MCP system. Each webhook can be configured with specific authentication requirements, input validation, and workflow associations.

```json
{
  "name": "n8n Product Processing",
  "description": "Webhook for n8n product data processing",
  "endpoint_path": "/product-processing",
  "workflow_id": "workflow_123",
  "method": "POST",
  "authentication_type": "api_key",
  "authentication_config": {
    "api_key": "your_secure_api_key"
  }
}
```

**n8n Workflow Configuration:**

In n8n, you configure HTTP Request nodes to call your Multi-Agent MCP webhook endpoints. The HTTP Request node should be configured with the webhook URL, appropriate headers, and authentication credentials.

For the webhook URL, use the format:
`https://5004-ij16cqdg6torl5w1ld6jw-72e62cc2.manusvm.computer/api/webhooks/trigger/{endpoint_path}`

**Data Flow Patterns:**

The integration supports several data flow patterns. The push pattern involves n8n sending data to the Multi-Agent MCP system for processing, with results returned in the HTTP response. This is suitable for real-time processing requirements.

The pull pattern involves n8n triggering processing in the Multi-Agent MCP system and then polling for results. This is useful for long-running operations that may take significant time to complete.

The hybrid pattern combines both approaches, with immediate acknowledgment of the request and subsequent notification when processing is complete. This provides the best user experience for complex workflows.

### Common Integration Scenarios

**E-commerce Data Processing:**

A common integration scenario involves processing product data from multiple e-commerce platforms. n8n can collect data from various sources (APIs, files, web scraping) and send it to the Multi-Agent MCP system for standardization and transformation.

The workflow might involve:
1. n8n collects product data from BestBuy API
2. Data is sent to Multi-Agent MCP for transformation to Walmart format
3. Transformed data is validated and stored
4. Results are sent back to n8n for further processing or notification

**Content Aggregation:**

Another scenario involves aggregating content from multiple websites for analysis or republishing. n8n can orchestrate the collection process while the Multi-Agent MCP system handles the actual scraping and content processing.

**Data Migration:**

For data migration projects, n8n can coordinate the migration process while the Multi-Agent MCP system handles the complex data transformation and validation tasks.

### Error Handling and Retry Logic

The integration includes comprehensive error handling to ensure reliable operation. When errors occur, the system provides detailed error information that n8n can use to implement appropriate retry logic or error notification.

The webhook system returns structured error responses that include error codes, messages, and suggested actions. This allows n8n workflows to implement sophisticated error handling strategies.

For transient errors, the system supports automatic retry with exponential backoff. For permanent errors, detailed error information is provided to help diagnose and resolve the underlying issues.

## API Reference

### Authentication

The Multi-Agent MCP system supports multiple authentication methods depending on the endpoint and configuration. For development and testing, many endpoints are accessible without authentication. For production use, appropriate authentication should be configured.

**API Key Authentication:**

For webhook endpoints, you can configure API key authentication by including the API key in the request headers:

```
X-API-Key: your_api_key_here
```

**Basic Authentication:**

Some endpoints support basic authentication using username and password:

```
Authorization: Basic base64(username:password)

## Use Cases and Examples

### E-commerce Data Transformation

One of the most powerful use cases for the Multi-Agent MCP system is transforming product data between different e-commerce platforms. This scenario demonstrates the system's ability to understand complex data structures and perform intelligent transformations.

**Scenario:** You need to migrate product catalog from BestBuy format to Walmart format for a client who sells on multiple platforms.

**Implementation:**

First, you would use Agent 1 to collect product data from BestBuy, either through their API or by scraping their website. The agent can handle authentication, rate limiting, and data extraction automatically.

```json
{
  "url": "https://api.bestbuy.com/v1/products",
  "authentication": {
    "type": "api_key",
    "key": "your_bestbuy_api_key"
  },
  "extract_fields": ["name", "price", "description", "category", "images"]
}
```

Next, Agent 4 analyzes the BestBuy data structure and creates an intelligent mapping to the Walmart format. The agent understands that BestBuy's "regularPrice" field maps to Walmart's "price" field, and "categoryPath" maps to "category_breadcrumb".

```json
{
  "source_template": "bestbuy_product",
  "target_template": "walmart_product",
  "data": {
    "name": "Samsung 55\" QLED 4K Smart TV",
    "regularPrice": 899.99,
    "categoryPath": [
      {"id": "abcat0101000", "name": "TVs"},
      {"id": "abcat0101001", "name": "LED TVs"}
    ],
    "longDescription": "Experience stunning picture quality..."
  }
}
```

The transformation result would be:

```json
{
  "product_name": "Samsung 55\" QLED 4K Smart TV",
  "price": 899.99,
  "category_breadcrumb": "Electronics > TVs > LED TVs",
  "description": "Experience stunning picture quality...",
  "confidence_score": 0.95
}
```

Finally, Agent 3 stores the transformed data in your database with full audit trails and backup capabilities.

### Content Aggregation and Analysis

Another powerful use case involves aggregating content from multiple sources for competitive analysis or market research.

**Scenario:** You want to monitor competitor pricing and product launches across multiple e-commerce sites.

**Implementation:**

Create a workflow that runs daily to collect competitor data:

1. Agent 1 scrapes competitor websites using persistent sessions
2. Agent 2 processes the collected content and creates searchable knowledge bases
3. Agent 4 standardizes the data format across all competitors
4. Agent 3 stores the results and generates trend analysis reports

The workflow can be triggered automatically by n8n on a schedule, with results delivered via email or dashboard updates.

### Document Processing and Knowledge Management

The system excels at processing large volumes of documents and creating searchable knowledge repositories.

**Scenario:** You have thousands of product manuals, specifications, and documentation that need to be searchable and accessible.

**Implementation:**

1. Upload documents to Agent 1 for processing and text extraction
2. Agent 2 creates embeddings and builds searchable knowledge bases
3. Implement natural language search interface for users
4. Agent 3 maintains backup and versioning of the knowledge base

Users can then search using natural language queries like "How to configure wireless settings on router model XYZ" and get relevant results even if the exact terminology doesn't match.

### Automated Data Pipeline

For organizations with complex data processing requirements, the system can implement fully automated data pipelines.

**Scenario:** Daily processing of sales data from multiple sources with transformation, validation, and reporting.

**Implementation:**

Create an n8n workflow that:
1. Collects data from various sources (APIs, FTP, email attachments)
2. Sends data to Multi-Agent MCP system for processing
3. Receives processed results and distributes reports
4. Handles errors and notifications automatically

The Multi-Agent MCP system handles the complex data transformation and validation logic while n8n orchestrates the overall process.
