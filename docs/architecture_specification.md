# Multi-Agent MCP System Architecture Specification

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the comprehensive architecture for a modular multi-agent system designed to handle complex data processing workflows. The system leverages the Model Context Protocol (MCP) for agent communication and integrates with n8n for workflow orchestration. The architecture emphasizes modularity, scalability, and intelligent data transformation capabilities.

## System Overview

The multi-agent system consists of four specialized agents working in concert to provide end-to-end data processing capabilities. Each agent operates independently while maintaining seamless communication through a shared messaging infrastructure and database layer.

2. **Scalability**: Horizontal scaling through containerization and load balancing
3. **Resilience**: Fault tolerance with automatic recovery mechanisms
4. **Flexibility**: Plugin-based architecture for easy extension
5. **Intelligence**: AI-powered decision making and data transformation

## Inter-Agent Communication

### Message Queue Architecture

The system uses Redis as a message broker to facilitate asynchronous communication between agents. Each agent subscribes to relevant channels and publishes messages when tasks are completed or assistance is needed.

**Message Types:**
- **Task Notifications**: New work available for processing
- **Status Updates**: Progress reports and completion notifications
- **Error Alerts**: Failure notifications with context
- **Data Requests**: Cross-agent data access requests
- **Configuration Changes**: System-wide setting updates

**Message Format:**
```json
{
  "id": "unique_message_id",
  "timestamp": "2025-01-18T10:30:00Z",
  "source_agent": "agent1_scraper",
  "target_agent": "agent2_knowledge",
  "message_type": "task_notification",
  "payload": {
    "task_id": "task_123",
    "data_location": "/shared/data/scraped_content.json",
    "metadata": {
      "source_url": "https://example.com",
      "content_type": "article",
      "priority": "high"
    }
  }
}
```

### API Gateway

A central API gateway provides unified access to all agent capabilities and manages authentication, rate limiting, and request routing.

**Endpoints:**
- `/api/v1/scraper/*` - Web scraping operations
- `/api/v1/knowledge/*` - Knowledge base management
- `/api/v1/database/*` - Data storage and retrieval
- `/api/v1/transformer/*` - Data transformation services
- `/api/v1/workflows/*` - n8n workflow integration

## Data Flow Architecture

### Primary Data Processing Pipeline

1. **Data Ingestion** (Agent 1)
   - User provides URLs or uploads files
   - Agent 1 scrapes content or processes files
   - Raw data stored in shared storage
   - Notification sent to Agent 2

2. **Knowledge Processing** (Agent 2)
   - Receives notification from Agent 1
   - Processes raw data into structured format
   - Generates embeddings and metadata
   - Stores processed knowledge in vector database
   - Notifies Agent 3 for persistent storage

3. **Data Storage** (Agent 3)
   - Receives processed data from Agent 2
   - Validates and stores in primary database
   - Creates indexes and relationships
   - Manages data lifecycle and cleanup
   - Provides access APIs for other agents

4. **Data Transformation** (Agent 4)
   - Accesses stored data through Agent 3
   - Analyzes templates and requirements
   - Performs intelligent mapping and transformation
   - Validates output and handles errors
   - Delivers transformed data to user

### Data Storage Strategy

**Shared File System:**
- `/shared/raw/` - Original scraped content and uploaded files
- `/shared/processed/` - Cleaned and structured data
